CollectiveAccess import directory README
----------------------------------------

Place directories of media files you wish to batch import into CollectiveAccess in this directory. You can then trigger an import by selecting "Import media" from the "Import" menu while logged in as a user with import privileges. To learn more about the media importer see http://docs.collectiveaccess.org/wiki/Media_import.

Note that the default location of this directory is within the web server root and may be web-accessible depending upon the configuration of your server. If you want to move the directory to another location be sure to update the "batch_media_import_root_directory" option in conf/app.conf.
